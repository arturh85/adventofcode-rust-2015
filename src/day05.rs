//! # [Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)
//! Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.
//!
//! A nice string is one with all of the following properties:
//!
//! -   It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.
//! -   It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`),
//!     or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).
//! -   It does not contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of
//!     the other requirements.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! -   `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`),
//!     a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.
//! -   `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though
//!     the letters used by different rules overlap.
//! -   `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.
//! -   `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.
//! -   `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.
//!
//! **How many strings are nice?**
//!
//! # Part Two
//!
//! Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a
//! string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.
//!
//! Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:
//!
//! -   It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without
//!     overlapping, like `xyxy` (`xy`) or `aabcdefgaa` (`aa`),
//!     but not like `aaa` (`aa`, but it overlaps).
//! -   It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them,
//!     like `xyx`, `abcdefeghi` (`efe`), or even `aaa`.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! -   `qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb` is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (`qj`) and a letter
//!     that repeats with exactly one letter between them (`zxz`).
//! -   `xxyxx` is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one
//!     between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
//! -   `uurcxstgmygtbstg` is naughty because it has a pair (`tg`) but no repeat with a single
//!     letter between them.
//! -   `ieodomkazucvgmuy` is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (`odo`),
//!     but no pair that appears twice.
//!
//! How many strings are nice under these new rules?
